# PyRestoManager
A restaurant management system created with Python and Tkinter.

Overview: This project is a inventory and employee management system created using Python, Tkinter and SQLite3 to provide the functionality of creating, modifying or removing employee and menu entries. The project also features a simple login/register portal for the user to maintain their records separately from other users.

How It Works:
This is a simple CRUD application with a lightweight interface and database functionality to understand how an app in Python is structured in terms of data, models, UI and business logic. The application works within a SPA (Single Page Application) context from start to finish, guiding the user through registration and the management screens where they can perform any kind of business action.
